# connect-four
Connect-four game on ruby terminal, first time using test to build.
This one taught me how crucial the tests are. Tests are sometimes slow and is boring but once you use it, it is nice to refactor the code
knowing if its working as intended or not. Also you can change methods and see how it affects others, if its working along with others 
or messing up the other methods.
